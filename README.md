# Card Battle Game ⚔️🃏

A turn-based card battle game written in C++, built as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course at Ben-Gurion University.

## Overview

Players choose a character class and battle against an enemy using a deck of cards. Each round, the player plays a valid set of cards from their hand to attack the enemy, while the enemy fights back. The game ends when either the player or the enemy runs out of health.

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- **Inheritance** — `Fighter`, `Sorcerer`, `Ranger` extend `Player`; `Troll`, `Ghost`, `Dragon` extend `Enemy`
- **Polymorphism** — virtual functions for `react_to()` and `attacked_by()`
- **Double Dispatch** — combat logic is resolved based on both the player's class and the enemy's class simultaneously
- **Operator Overloading** — `+=` and `-=` for `Deck`, `[]` for card access
- **Exception Handling** — custom `DeckEmptyException`, `bad_alloc` caught with proper cleanup

## Characters

**Players:**
- 🗡️ **Fighter** — melee warrior
- 🔮 **Sorcerer** — magic caster
- 🏹 **Ranger** — ranged attacker

**Enemies:**
- 👹 **Troll**
- 👻 **Ghost**
- 🐉 **Dragon**

Each player-enemy combination has unique combat logic, resulting in 9 different battle interactions.

## How to Build & Run

**Requirements:** G++ with C++11 or later, Make

```bash
make
./card_battle
```

## Gameplay

1. Initialize the deck by entering cards (format: `RS` where R=rank, S=suit). Enter `00` to stop.
2. Choose your player class (Fighter / Sorcerer / Ranger)
3. Choose your enemy (Troll / Ghost / Dragon)
4. Each turn, play a valid set of cards from your hand
5. The game ends when either side reaches 0 health or the deck runs out
